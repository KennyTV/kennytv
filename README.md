I am an upsidedown person, currently studying to become a teacher, and develop open source software around the game Minecraft in my free time: Mainly [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion), but also a few smaller projects, like [Maintenance](https://github.com/KennyTV/Maintenance) or [WorldEditSUI](https://github.com/KennyTV/WorldEditSUI).
